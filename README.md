# Motion Canvas CLI

Motion Canvas CLI serves to act like `ng` for Angular, but for [Motion Canvas](https://motioncanvas.io/)

The goal is to publish this as an npm package, or eventually try and integrate into the motion canvas project. 

For now, this is a work in progress and my first attept at making a npm package, command line app, and a whole lot more.
